## Hi 👋 I am Henri!
I am a simple computer technician striving to learn new technologies and improve ones that already have some knowledge. I am currently focusing on web development with PHP and JS. I like both programming and infrastructure, so I also have a little knowledge in the area, about Linux, Email, Informix, but I'm trying to focus on learning one thing at a time.

- 👨🏽‍💻 I currently work as a technical support analyst
- 🤝 Open for collaborations in deep learning, analytics and data science.
- 😊 Willing to contribute in opensource projects.
- 👍 Looking for opportunities to join as an intern/full time candidate in machine learning/deep learning research teams.
- 🌐 Visit my [porfolio website](https://hnrazevedo.github.io/) for complete background and contact. (under development)
